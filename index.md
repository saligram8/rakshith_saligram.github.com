## Hi, I'm Rakshith Saligram 
I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Integrated Circuits and Systems Research Lab <a href="https://icsrl.ece.gatech.edu"> (ICSRL) </a>, working under Prof. <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/arijit-raychowdhury"> Arijit Raychowdhury. </a> I am currently working on Cryogenic CMOS circuits where I am investigating the behavior of bulk CMOS, FDSOI and FinFETS at low temperatures for applications in the areas of High Performance Computing and Quantum Interface Circuits. I am also dedicating some time and interest on modeling of High Speed Interconnects for 2.5D and 3D Integrated Circuits.  You can find my recent publications under the Publications tab and my CV under the Vitae. I've briefed my academic and corporate experiences below.
