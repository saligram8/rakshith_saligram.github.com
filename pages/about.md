I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I was born and brought up in the beautiful city of Bangalore, Karnataka India. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering and I am a proud alum of the first private engineering college in India - BMS College of Engineering (Est. 1946). I also go a chance to work as a full time faculty in the same college for an year where I taught Freshmen, Sophomore and Junior Students. 

I did my Masters in Electrical Engineering in the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California majoring in VLSI and Computer Architecture. Later I started to work at Intel Corporation in Folsom California, as a Graphics Hardware Engineer. The role was a back-end Physical Design (RTL-GDS-II flow execution) and was a part of the Dual-Sub-Slice Macro team where I worked on multiple generations of Graphic Technologies. My specialization was timing closure, quality rules closure to mention a few. I served as Section-Timing Owner, Section Performance-Verification Owner, Section Quality Owner along with partition closures for multiple projects on cutting edge technologies. 

With penchant for academics and research, I started my PhD at Georgia Tech and have been currently working on Cryogenic CMOS VLSI circuits. My main focus so far has been towards high-performance computing using cryo-systems and to explore different technologies along with CMOS that can be efficiently exploited for HPC.  

I enjoy listening Carnatic Classical Music, cooking and hiking in my free time.
